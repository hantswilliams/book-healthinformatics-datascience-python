# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Write and execute your first Python code
- Understand how programming languages work at a high level
- Use the interactive Python editor to run code

## ðŸ¤” Why Python?

Python is one of many [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages), but it's special for several reasons:

### ðŸŒŸ Why Python is Amazing

1. **Easy to Read and Write**
   - Python code looks almost like English
   - Clean, consistent syntax
   - Perfect for beginners

2. **Powerful for Healthcare**
   - Excellent for data analysis
   - Great libraries for medical research
   - Strong in machine learning

### ðŸ”„ How Python Works

Python is an [interpreted language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)), which means:
- You write human-readable code
- Python's interpreter translates it for the computer
- You see results immediately!

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

In this course, we're using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), which lets you run Python right in your web browser! No installation needed.

#### Using the Editor Below

1. **Write Code**: Type your Python code in the editor
2. **Run It**: Click the "Run Code" button or press âŒ˜+Enter (Ctrl+Enter on Windows)
3. **See Results**: Watch your output appear in the console
4. **Try Again**: Made a mistake? Just fix it and run again!

## ðŸ’» Your First Python Program

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program. In Python, we use the `print()` function to display text:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

> **Pro Tip:** In Python, you can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) for text strings.

## ðŸš€ Make It Personal

Now it's your turn! Modify the code below to print a greeting with your name:

```python
# Try changing 'Jane' to your own name!
print('Hello, Jane!')
```

> **Challenge:** Can you print multiple lines? Try using multiple `print()` statements or the special `\n` character for new lines!
