# Variables and Data Types

Great job on your first Python program! Now let's explore variables and data types, which are fundamental concepts in programming.

## What are Variables?

Variables are containers that store data values. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can store information.

## Python Data Types

Python has several built-in data types:

### Numbers
- **Integers** (`int`): Whole numbers like 42, -10, 0
- **Floats** (`float`): Decimal numbers like 3.14, -2.5, 0.0

### Text
- **Strings** (`str`): Text enclosed in quotes like "Hello", 'Python', "Patient ID: 12345"

### Boolean
- **Boolean** (`bool`): True or False values

### Collections (we'll cover these later)
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs

## Variable Naming Rules

- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Cannot start with a number
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different)
- Cannot use Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `while`)

## Best Practices for Healthcare Data

When working with healthcare data, use descriptive variable names:
- `patient_age` instead of `a`
- `systolic_pressure` instead of `sp`
- `medication_dosage` instead of `dose`

Let's practice creating and working with different types of variables!
