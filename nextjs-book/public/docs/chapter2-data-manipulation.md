# Data Manipulation Concepts

Excellent work exploring your first healthcare dataset! Now let's learn essential data manipulation techniques that you'll use daily in health informatics.

## Essential Data Operations

### Filtering Data
Filtering allows you to select specific patients or records based on criteria:
- Patients over 65 years old
- Diabetic patients with HbA1c > 7.0
- Patients admitted in the last 30 days
- Emergency department visits on weekends

### Sorting Data
Sorting helps you organize data for analysis:
- Sort patients by age (oldest to youngest)
- Sort lab results by date (most recent first)
- Sort hospitals by patient volume
- Sort medications by frequency of prescription

### Grouping Data
Grouping allows you to analyze data by categories:
- Average length of stay by hospital department
- Medication adherence rates by age group
- Readmission rates by diagnosis
- Cost analysis by insurance type

## Common Healthcare Data Challenges

### Missing Data
Real healthcare data is often incomplete:
- Patient didn't show up for follow-up appointment
- Lab results not yet available
- Historical records from different systems

### Data Quality Issues
Healthcare data can be messy:
- Inconsistent date formats
- Duplicate patient records
- Coding errors in diagnoses
- Units of measurement variations

### Privacy Considerations
Always remember HIPAA compliance:
- Remove or mask patient identifiers
- Use aggregate statistics when possible
- Secure data storage and transmission
- Limited access based on need-to-know

## Best Practices

1. **Always explore your data first** - understand what you're working with
2. **Document your data transformations** - others need to understand your process
3. **Validate your results** - does the analysis make clinical sense?
4. **Handle missing data appropriately** - don't just ignore it
5. **Keep patient privacy paramount** - follow all regulations

Let's practice these concepts with real healthcare scenarios!
