# Chapter 1 Summary

Congratulations! You've completed Chapter 1 and learned the fundamentals of Python programming.

## What You've Learned

✅ **Python Basics**
- Understood why Python is great for health informatics
- Learned about Python's clean and readable syntax

✅ **Your First Program**
- Wrote and executed your first Python program
- Used the `print()` function to display output

✅ **Variables and Data Types**
- Created variables to store different types of data
- Worked with integers, floats, strings, and booleans
- Learned best practices for naming variables in healthcare contexts

## Key Concepts to Remember

- **Variables** are containers for storing data
- **Data types** determine what kind of data you can store
- **Good variable names** make your code readable and maintainable
- Python is **case-sensitive** - `Age` and `age` are different variables

## Coming Up Next

In Chapter 2, we'll dive into data analysis with Pandas, where you'll learn to:
- Load and explore healthcare datasets
- Filter and sort patient data
- Create visualizations to understand trends

## Practice Before Moving On

Try creating variables for a patient record:
- Patient ID (string)
- Age (integer) 
- Weight (float)
- Has insurance (boolean)
