# Introduction to Pandas

Welcome to Chapter 2! Now that you understand Python basics, it's time to dive into data analysis with **Pandas** - the most powerful Python library for working with healthcare data.

## What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library that provides data structures and analysis tools for handling structured data. Think of it as Excel, but much more powerful and programmatic.

## Why Pandas for Healthcare?

Healthcare data comes in many forms:
- **Patient records** with demographics, diagnoses, and treatments
- **Clinical trial data** with measurements over time  
- **Electronic health records (EHR)** with complex relationships
- **Public health datasets** with population statistics

Pandas excels at:
- ✅ Loading data from various sources (CSV, Excel, databases)
- ✅ Cleaning and preprocessing messy healthcare data
- ✅ Filtering patients based on criteria (age, diagnosis, etc.)
- ✅ Calculating statistics (average blood pressure, BMI distributions)
- ✅ Grouping data (by hospital, physician, treatment type)

## Key Pandas Concepts

### DataFrames
A **DataFrame** is like a spreadsheet - it has rows and columns. Each row represents a record (like a patient), and each column represents a variable (like age, diagnosis, or lab results).

### Series
A **Series** is a single column of data, like a list of patient ages or blood pressure readings.

## What You'll Learn

In this chapter, you'll master:

1. **Loading healthcare datasets** into Pandas
2. **Exploring and summarizing** patient data
3. **Filtering and sorting** records based on medical criteria  
4. **Creating visualizations** to understand health trends
