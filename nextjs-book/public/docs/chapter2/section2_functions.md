## Built-in Functions and Common Usage:
Pandas comes with hundreds of built-in functions that facilitate data manipulation, analysis, and transformation. When you import pandas, it's common to use the alias `pd` to make it easier to reference functions:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

The pandas library is extensive, and it's impossible to know all its functionalities by heart. This is where the pandas documentation becomes invaluable. The documentation provides detailed explanations, examples, and usage patterns for each function and feature. Learning to navigate and utilize the documentation effectively is a key skill for mastering pandas or any other Python package.
