# Testing Execution Modes

## What's Been Implemented

âœ… **Database Schema**: Added execution modes to chapters and sections
âœ… **Enhanced Chapter Builder**: Monaco editor with execution mode controls  
âœ… **API Routes**: Updated to handle execution mode data
âœ… **Execution-Aware Python Editor**: Manages shared vs isolated Pyodide instances
âœ… **Student Chapter Viewer**: Shows execution mode indicators and uses correct execution contexts

## How to Test

1. **Create a Course with Mixed Execution Modes**:
   - Go to `/org/demo-org/dashboard/content`  
   - Click "ðŸš€ Enhanced Builder"
   - Create a chapter with `defaultExecutionMode: 'shared'`
   - Add Python sections with:
     - Section 1: `var1 = 'cool kids'` (execution mode: shared)
     - Section 2: `print(var1)` (execution mode: shared)

2. **View the Chapter as a Student**:
   - Navigate to the chapter view page
   - You should see:
     - Blue ðŸ”— "Shared State" indicators
     - Variables persist between Python cells
     - Same Pyodide instance used for all shared sections

3. **Test Isolated Mode**:
   - Create sections with execution mode: isolated
   - You should see:
     - Green ðŸ”’ "Isolated State" indicators  
     - Each cell runs independently
     - Variables don't persist between cells

## Expected Behavior

### Shared Mode (ðŸ”—):
```python
# Cell 1:
var1 = 'cool kids'

# Cell 2: 
print(var1)  # Should output: cool kids
```

### Isolated Mode (ðŸ”’):
```python
# Cell 1:
var1 = 'cool kids'

# Cell 2:
print(var1)  # Should error: NameError: name 'var1' is not defined
```

## Architecture

- **Shared Mode**: All sections in chapter use same Pyodide instance (`sharedPyodideInstances[chapterId]`)
- **Isolated Mode**: Each section gets its own Pyodide instance (`isolatedPyodideInstances[sectionId]`)  
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear UI shows execution context for each section
- **Inheritance**: Sections can inherit chapter's default execution mode

The system now properly supports both execution models as requested! ðŸŽ‰
