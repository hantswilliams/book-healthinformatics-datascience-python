    "text": "Why?\nI started off, and still identify as a nurse, but now find myself somewhere between the interaction of clinician and technologist. My job as a professor involves teaching, and constantly aquiring new knowledge, abilities, and skills (KSAs) between evidence based medicine (EBM) and technology-focused tools that could be used to help us address these issues. My curiosity and passion for BOTH healthcare and technology has led me to pursue a variety of topics that I try to address in this book. So what does this book cover?\nThis book covers python, healthcare data, medical codexes, open source datasets, databases, cloud technologies, inferential statistics and machine learning, visualizations, and related technologies important to understand as a modern (future) health informaticsts.\nI’ve created this book as the most important topics to me, and what I have experienced within academic medical hospital systems, private hospitals, consulting, and health tech-startups.

These core technologies: databases, scripts, clouds, code languages, databases, medical codexes…etc that we will be exploring should be viewed as individual lego pieces. It is our job as health informaticists to understand which pieces exist, what they are capability of providing to us, and then how we can put them together to make something unique and useful. Key word is useful.\n\n\n\nImage of LEGO bricks as a metaphor for learning blocks",
